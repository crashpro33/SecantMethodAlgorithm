# SecantMethodAlgorithm

General Info: This is a function for the secant method. It takes in a function, initial values, tolerance, and
maximum iterations and outputs the required iterations to find a root and the root.
This method uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f. 
The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method.
